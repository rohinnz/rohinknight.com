Hi, I'm Rohin Knight, a Technical Artist with over a decade of experience in game development. I specialize in bridging the gap between art and engineering â€” building high-quality tools, systems, and pipelines that empower creative teams to deliver their best work.

I've worked for [PlaySide Studios](https://www.playsidestudios.com/), [PikPok](https://pikpok.com/) and [Myria](https://myria.com/). The most recent titles I worked on are
* [Civilization VII - VR](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-vr/5781689118524197/)
* [Shattered](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/shattered/5816339365118691/) (Meta Quest 3 Mixed Reality)
* Unannounced AAA Unreal Game

For more details please see my [portfolio]({% link 04_portfolio.md %}).

Outside of game development, my interests are studying Mandarin, hiking and snowboarding.
