Hi, I’m Rohin Knight, a programmer with over 15 years of commercial experience and over eight years of experience in the games industry.
During my career, I’ve developed games, mobile apps and websites while working with some fantastic people in startups to large corporate companies. 

I love tackling new challenges and helping people solve complex problems, and I have a proven track record for completing tasks on time and under pressure.

My passion is Web3 gaming, and it is so exciting to be pioneering in this space with bleeding-edge technology. I am currently building a Web3 puzzle game where players will be able to mint their own puzzles as NFTs. I have also recently written two posts about Smart Contract security and optimization:
* [How to Prevent Reentrancy Attacks in Solidity]({% link _posts/2023-01-15-Reentrancy-Attacks.md %})
* [Optimizing Smart Contract Gas Costs]({% link _posts/2023-01-20-Solidity-Gas-Optimization.md %})

Please see my [portfolio]({% link 04_portfolio.md %}) for more information.

## Other Interests

Outside of coding, my other interests are studying Mandarin, travel, hiking and snowboarding. My favourite ski field is [Cardrona](https://www.cardrona.com/).
