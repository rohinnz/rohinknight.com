Hi, I'm Rohin Knight.

I'm a programmer with over 15 years of commercial experience and over eight years of experience in the games industry.

During my career, I've developed websites, apps and games. My current experience is in Blockchain Programming, Unity Game Development and Technical Art.

I have a passion for Web3 gaming. Coming from the more traditional free-to-play industry, I absolutely love the idea of giving users complete ownership of their in-game items as NFTs.

I am currently working on my own Web3 game, [Block Miner]({% link blockminer.md %}).

## Other Interests

Outside of coding, my other interests are studying Mandarin, travel, hiking and snowboarding. Favourite ski field is [Cardrona](https://www.cardrona.com/).
