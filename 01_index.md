**Hi, I'm Rohin Knight — a Technical Artist and Programmer with over a decade of experience in the games industry.**

I specialize in solving complex technical challenges and building high-quality tools and systems for game studios and creative teams.

I’ve contributed to projects built in Unity (C#, C++, native plugins), Unreal Engine (C++, PCG, Blueprints, Niagara), and proprietary engines — delivering everything from procedural generation tools to optimized render pipelines, custom shaders, and cross-platform builds (iOS, Android, WebGL, Steam, Quest 3 Mixed Reality).

My background also includes technical art scripting (Photoshop, Maya, Blender), Web3 development (Solidity, Hardhat), and mobile app engineering (iOS/Android).

I've worked with studios including **[PlaySide Studios](https://www.playsidestudios.com/)**, **[PikPok](https://pikpok.com/)** and **[Myria](https://myria.com/)**.

Recent titles include:
* **[Civilization VII - VR](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-vr/5781689118524197/)**
* **[Shattered](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/shattered/5816339365118691/)** (Meta Quest 3 Mixed Reality)
* **Unannounced AAA Unreal Game**

**You can find more details in my [portfolio]({% link 04_portfolio.md %}).**

## Other Interests
Outside of game development, my interests are studying Mandarin, hiking and snowboarding.
