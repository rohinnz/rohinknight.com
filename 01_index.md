Hello, my name is Rohin Knight and I am a seasoned programmer with 15 years of commercial experience across various domains. Throughout my career, I have developed games, mobile apps and websites while collaborating with some talented individuals from startups to large corporations.

I currently specialize in Game Development (including Tech Art) and Blockchain Programming. I thrive on taking on new challenges and finding creative solutions to complex problems. My track record speaks for itself, consistently delivering high-quality work and being able to deliver on time and under pressure.

For more information about my experience and skills, please check out my [portfolio]({% link 04_portfolio.md %}).

## Other Interests

Outside of coding, my other interests are studying Mandarin, travel, hiking and snowboarding. My favourite ski field is [Cardrona](https://www.cardrona.com/).
