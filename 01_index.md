Hi, I'm Rohin Knight.

I'm a programmer with over 15 years of commercial experience and over eight years of experience in the games industry.

During my career, I've developed games, mobile apps and websites.

I've worked with some fantastic people in startups to large corporate companies.

I love tackling new challenges and helping people solve complex problems.

My current experience is in Blockchain Programming, Unity Game Development and Technical Art.

I am passionate about Web3 gaming and am currently working on my own Web3 game, [Block Miner]({% link blockminer.md %}).

I have also written two posts about Smart Contract security and optimization:
* [How to Prevent Reentrancy Attacks in Solidity]({% link _posts/2023-01-15-Reentrancy-Attacks.md %})
* [Optimizing Smart Contract Gas Costs]({% link _posts/2023-01-20-Solidity-Gas-Optimization.md %})

## Other Interests

Outside of coding, my other interests are studying Mandarin, travel, hiking and snowboarding. My favourite ski field is [Cardrona](https://www.cardrona.com/).
