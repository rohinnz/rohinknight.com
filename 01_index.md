Hi, I'm Rohin Knight.

I'm a programmer with over 15 years of commercial experience and over eight years of experience in the games industry.

During my career, I've developed games, mobile apps and websites.

I've worked with some fantastic people in startups to large corporate companies.

I never shy away from a new challenge and love helping people solve complex problems.

My current experience is in Blockchain Programming, Unity Game Development and Technical Art.

I am very passionate about Web3 gaming and am currently working on my own Web3 game, [Block Miner]({% link blockminer.md %}).

## Other Interests

Outside of coding, my other interests are studying Mandarin, travel, hiking and snowboarding. My favourite ski field is [Cardrona](https://www.cardrona.com/).
