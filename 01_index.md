Hello, my name is Rohin Knight. I'm a Software Engineer / Technical Artist with over 10 years of experience in Game Development. I have a proven record of delivering quality work and solving complex problems.

I've worked for [PlaySide Studios](https://www.playsidestudios.com/), [PikPok](https://pikpok.com/) and [Myria](https://myria.com/).

Most recent titles I worked on are 
* [Civilization VII - VR](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-vr/5781689118524197/)
* [Shattered (Meta Quest 3 Mixed Reality)](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/shattered/5816339365118691/)
* Unannounced AAA Unreal Game

For more details please see my [portfolio]({% link 04_portfolio.md %}).

Outside of game development, my interests are studying Mandarin, hiking and snowboarding.
