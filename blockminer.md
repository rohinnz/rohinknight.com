Block Miner is a Web3 puzzle game where players can mint their own puzzles as NFTs.

There will be competitions for solving larger puzzles which will be a combination of normal NFT puzzles.

Also players will be able to earn royalties when their NFT is used in a larger puzzle.

This project is currently being built on L1 Ethereum and has many challenges due to security and gas costs. There is a chance it may end up being built on L2 using zkSync.

The source code for the Smart Contracts is available on GitHub:<br />[github.com/rohinnz/Block-Miner-Smart-Contracts](https://github.com/rohinnz/Block-Miner-Smart-Contracts).

More Info coming soon.

### Prototype

Coming soon.

<!--
WARNING: Current prototype is very rough. The main goal of this prototype is testing Smart Contracts on the Goerli testnet.
